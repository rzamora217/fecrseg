Fecrseg
=====

MOOSE-based Application for simulating Radiation Induced Segregation (RIS) of Cr in FeCr Alloys

runfecrseg.py is a helpful python script for running the code. To use it, I recommend copying the script outside (but next to) of the fecrseg/ directory, and using it there.

For more MOOSE information see: [http://mooseframework.org/create-an-app/](http://mooseframework.org/create-an-app/)
